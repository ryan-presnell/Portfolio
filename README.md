Some of my data science projects:

## College Basketball Analysis

[Paper](College Basketball Analysis.docx)

[Code](College Basketball Analysis Code.html)

Using data on college basketball teams such as offensive/defensive efficiency and power rating, I attempted to make predictions including picking a bracket for the 2019 NCAA MBB tournament. Included is the 5-page paper with analysis and the code file. 

## Student Grades Project 

[Code (Rmd file)](Student-Grades-Project-Code.Rmd)

[PPT Slides](Student-Grades-Project-Slides.pptx)

This was a final project for a class (LING 460 - Textual Data in R). I presented this PowerPoint in front of my peers. In this project, students' grade ranges were predicted using multiple classification methods.

## Terror Project
[Code](Terror-Project-Code.html)

[Dashboard](Terror-Project-Dashboard.png)

This is primarily a cleaning & visualization (in Tableau and ggplot2) project. Data describes terrorist attacks from the year 2001 onward. Data was scraped from TROP.

## Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

[Code & Discussion](reviews-sentiment-analysis.html)

I first scraped one positive & negative review for each of the top 250 rated imdb movies. I then utilized two modeling methods - the bag of words method & bigram method - in order to predict whether the reviews in the test data were positive or negative reviews.
