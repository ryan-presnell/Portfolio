Some of my data science projects:

## Student Grades Project 

[Code (Rmd file)](Student-Grades-Project-Code.Rmd)

[PPT Slides](Student-Grades-Project-Slides.pptx)

This was a data science school project (LING 460). I presented this PowerPoint in front of my peers. The code file is a bit lacking in the organization/comments department. I have since made improvements in these areas. In this project, students' grade ranges were predicted using multiple classification methods. Other statistical analyses such as Student's t-tests and ANOVA tests were also done.

## Terror Project
[Code](Terror-Project-Code.html)
[Dashboard](Terror-Project-Dashboard.png)

Statistical analysis & visualization of terrorist attack data from the year 2001 onward. Data was scraped from TROP.

## Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

[Code & Discussion](reviews-sentiment-analysis.html)

One positive & negative review for each of the top 250 rated imdb movies were scraped. I then utilized two modeling methods - the bag of words method & bigram method - in order to predict whether the reviews in the test data were positive or negative reviews.
