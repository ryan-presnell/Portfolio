Some of my data science projects:

## Student Grades Project 

[Code (Rmd file)](Student-Grades-Project-Code.Rmd)

[PPT Slides](Student-Grades-Project-Slides.pptx)

This was a data science school project (LING 460 - Textual Data in R). I presented this PowerPoint in front of my peers. Sadly I no longer have access to the data, so I will have to keep the file as an Rmd instead of knitting it to an html. In this project, students' grade ranges were predicted using multiple classification methods. Other statistical analyses such as Student's t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, and ANOVA tests were also performed.

## Terror Project
[Code](Terror-Project-Code.html)

[Dashboard](Terror-Project-Dashboard.png)

This is primarily a cleaning & visualization (in Tableau and ggplot2) project. Data describes terrorist attacks from the year 2001 onward. Data was scraped from TROP.

## Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

[Code & Discussion](reviews-sentiment-analysis.html)

I first scraped one positive & negative review for each of the top 250 rated imdb movies. I then utilized two modeling methods - the bag of words method & bigram method - in order to predict whether the reviews in the test data were positive or negative reviews. 

## Credit Card Eligibility Detection

Code & PPT slides to be posted once I can get a working charger for my old laptop
