My data science projects:

Student Grades Project 

This was a data science school project (LING 460). I presented this PowerPoint in front of my peers. The code file is a bit lacking in the organization/comments department. I have since made improvements in these areas. In this project, students' grade ranges were predicted using multiple classification methods. Other statistical analyses such as Student's t-tests and ANOVA tests were also done.

Terror Project

Statistical analysis & visualization of terrorist attack data from the year 2001 onward. Data was scraped from TROP.
