[Code](College-Basketball-Analysis-Code.html)

Using data on college basketball teams such as offensive/defensive efficiency and power rating, I attempted to make predictions including picking a re-prediction of the 2019 NCAA MBB tournament. Included is the 5-page paper with analysis & code file. 

## Misc.

### Terror Project

[Dashboard](Terror-Project-Dashboard.png)

This is primarily a cleaning & visualization (in Tableau and ggplot2) project. Data describes terrorist attacks from the year 2001 onward & was scraped from TROP.

### Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

[Code & Discussion](reviews-sentiment-analysis.html)

I first scraped one positive & negative review for each of the top 250 rated imdb movies. I then utilized two modeling methods - the bag of words method & bigram method - in order to predict whether the reviews in the test data were positive or negative reviews.
